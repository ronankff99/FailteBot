utter_in_ireland_city, In Ireland\, city and county councils (also known as local authorities) provide social housing for people who cannot afford housing from their own resources. You should call into your local authority office and ask their help and advice about finding somewhere to live.
utter_housing_associations_and, Housing associations and housing co-operatives also provide social housing for people who cannot afford to buy their own homes or rent a home in the private sector. You can find a list of housing associations at www.citizensinformation.ie (click on ‚ÄòHousing‚Äô).
utter_not_everyone_has, Not everyone has a right to local authority housing. It depends on your eligibility and needs, including household income limits. There is also a long waiting list. The rent is decided based on the income (after tax) of all people over 18 living in the home. You must fill out an application form for local authority housing. Your local authority or local Citizens Information Centre can help you with this.
utter_housing_associations_and_2, Housing associations and housing co-operatives also have rules about who may be eligible for their housing. Again\, your local Citizens Information Centre can help with this.
what_points_do, What points do I need to watch for when applying for social housing support?

utter_general_points_2, In general, you must already be living in the area covered by that housing authority or have a local connection with the area through previous residence\, current employment\, medical care\, education or relatives ‚Äì though a housing authority may agree to waive (ignore) this requirement.
utter_general_points_3, You must send a completed application form to the relevant local authority. You can get the forms from the authority
utter_general_points_4, When completing the application form\, you can choose up to three areas (‚ÄúAreas of Choice‚Äù) within the local authority area you want to live. However\, if applying to an authority in Dublin\, Cork or Galway\, you can choose three areas in that county\, one of which must be in the area of the authority you are applying to.
utter_general_points_5, Your application will be assessed by the local authority based on eligibility criteria, including income\, right of residency and the availability of alternative accommodation.
utter_general_points_6, Once you satisfy the eligibility criteria\, your housing need will be assessed. This assessment takes account of your current accommodation
utter_general_points_7, If your local authority decides that you meet both the eligibility and need criteria you will be placed on a waiting list (now known as a ‚Äòrecord of qualified households‚Äô). Each local authority decides on its own rules for deciding order of priority on the waiting list (an ‚ÄúAllocation Scheme‚Äù). You can get a copy of this scheme from your local authority.
utter_general_points_8, While you have some choice in specifying the areas where you would like to live, you should remember that if you choose a popular area, you may wait longer for an offer of housing than if you choose a less popular area. The demand for social housing is high and you can expect to wait a number of years before a local authority can offer you a house (depending on your housing needs and availability of suitable accommodation)

utter_if_you_do, If you do not qualify for social housing or will have to wait a long time for social housing\, you should look at renting in the private sector.
