# FailteBot
FÃ¡ilteBot - A multilingual chatbot for refugees in Ireland

## Explainer
This is a Final Year Project for the Software Development Lvl 8 program at Munster Technological University. It is a modification to a Rasa 1 chatbot that allows for easy implementation of multilingualism. Content for the conversations has been taken from 'The Guide to Living Independently', available at www.gov.ie. If you would like a copy of the thesis I can be reached at my username + @gmail.com.
